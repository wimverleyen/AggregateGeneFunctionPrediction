#AggregateGeneFunctionPrediction

This code is designed at the Gillis Lab in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories by Wim Verleyen

Gene function prediction with aggregation of data resources and algorithms

Six 'off-the-shelf' algorithms are used from scikit-learn:

-) Logistic regression
-) Random forest
-) Stochastic gradient descent
-) Passive aggressive
-) Random walks with restarts
-) Neighbor voting

Gene Ontology:
-) Code to load Matlab matrices/vectors of the gene identifiers, GO term identifiers, and GO term annotation matrix.

Model:
-) Plot
	Code of the performance measures
-) Database
	Code of the MySQL queries
