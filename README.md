#AggregateGeneFunctionPrediction

This code is designed at the Gillis Lab in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories by Wim Verleyen.

Gene function prediction with aggregation of data resources and algorithms. This code is used for generation results for publications.

##Six off-the-shelf algorithms are used from scikit-learn:

* Logistic regression
* Random forest
* Stochastic gradient descent
* Passive aggressive
* Random walks with restarts
* Neighbor voting (Guilt-by-association)

##Gene Ontology
Code to load Matlab matrices/vectors of the gene identifiers, GO term identifiers, and GO term annotation matrix.

##Model
###Plot
Code of the performance measures
###Database
Code of the MySQL queries

## Replicability in gene network analysis
